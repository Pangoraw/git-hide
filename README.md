# Git Hide package

This package allows you to automatically hide files and folders according to the `.gitignore` file you may have at the root of your project.
You can use `ctrl+h` to toggle the visibility of the ignored files.

The package basically only had a keyboard shorcut for hide VCS option of the  `atom/tree-view` package.
So make sure you have it installed.
